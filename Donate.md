If you want to support the project you have a lot of options. Money alone does not make a project succesful and we are glad to get your support in any form. You can:  

- Evangelize, spread the word.
- Submit cool Sverchok generated content to the Gallery
- Write code (including scripted node templates) and share
- Help improve the documentation (rst)
- Or you can send money.
